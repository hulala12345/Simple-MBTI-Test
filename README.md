# Simple MBTI Test

This repository contains a small command-line script that runs a 20-question MBTI personality test. The questions cover the four MBTI dimensions and calculate your scores for each pair.

## Running the Test

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Execute the script with:

```bash
python3 mbti_test.py
```

Answer each question by typing `A` or `B`. After the questions, the program will display your MBTI type, the percentage breakdown for each dimension, and a brief personality analysis with strengths, weaknesses, and development suggestions.
